    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <p>I create electronic music because it gives me a space where identity can be fluid, expressive, and honest. I grew up between Venezuela and Honduras, but when I make music, I don’t feel obligated to represent either in a stereotypical way. At the same time, I don’t fully align with the scenes of American electronic music either. My work lives in the in-between.
I’ve felt that music becomes most powerful when I stop trying to label it or force an emotion onto it. I prefer to create first and analyze later. When I sit down with my gear, my laptop, or a modular rack, I’m not thinking, “This needs to sound Latin,” or “This needs to sound experimental”. I’m trying to make something real that reflects the parts of my story that don’t have a clear category. I like to think that my sound comes from instinct, curiosity, and the urge to explore textures and processes that feel alive.
As a Venezuelan-Honduran artist studying in the United States, I’ve had access to multiple scenes and communities. I don’t see myself as someone choosing between them; if anything, I see myself as someone bridging them together. One of my philosophies comes from the DIY ideology. I’ve learned not to wait until everything is “perfect” or academically approved. Sometimes you have to show up with what you have and say, This is my process, and it matters.
Right now, I’m focused on live coding and crafting my own synthesis tools from scratch. There’s something inspiring about building your own instrument. It breaks down the barrier between the performer and the machine. 
At the core of everything I do is a desire to experiment honestly. I don’t believe there’s a “correct” artistic method. Some of the most meaningful audio and visual textures I’ve created have come from accidents or from processes that would never show up in a textbook. But at the same time, I’m all for learning the rules so that I can break them intentionally.
