      <!-- TEXT SECTION -->
      <div class="bio-text">
        <p>N3blina (Matteo Mendoza) is a Venezuelan-Honduran electronic performer, controllerist, and sound designer exploring new ways to make electronic music feel expressive and alive. His work blends modular synthesis, live-coding, audiovisual systems, and hands-on controllerism to create performance environments where technology feels charged with human energy and emotion.
His philosophy: create first, analyze later. He rejects the idea of forcing a predefined emotion or “correct” method in art, instead letting experimentation, instinct, and personal story lead the process. This approach allows him to inject at least a small percentage of the uniqueness of his story into his craft. 
Matteo is a full-scholarship student at Berklee College of Music and has collaborated with visual artist and photographer Ángel Leonel, contributing music for editorial work.
Currently, he is developing new audiovisual feedback systems, refining his live electronic performance setup, and expanding his portfolio as an innovative sound designer, controllerist, and audiovisual artist.
