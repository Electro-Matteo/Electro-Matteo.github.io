<h1>Our Band</h1>
<img src="Members.jpg" alt="Band Image">

<h3>Matteo #1</h3>
<p>Matteo #1 had some sacred knowledge on vocal modulation and synth sorcery after he defeated a dream-realm sorcerer of antiquity in a reverb duel.</p>
  
<h3>Matteo #2</h3>
<p>Matteo #2 was born out of a malfunctioning Tr808 after it had circuit problems. He's so crazy he can even summon a perfectly quantized 4 on the floor just with his mind.</p>

<h3>Matteo #3</h3>
<p>Matteo #3 is no musician but makes moves for the band to thrive. He is great at getting interdimensional tour contracts. If it wasn't for him the band would've probably sold their soul by now.</p>
